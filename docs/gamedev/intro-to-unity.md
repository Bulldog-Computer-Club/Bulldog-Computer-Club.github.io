## Creating a Project

- You can create a new project by selecting 'New'
- Make sure to select '2D'
- Give your project a name and save it to a location that you can easily access

## The Editor

First, we need to reorder the editor for easier use (follow steps in picture)

### Setting up the Project Tab

This is where we keep all our assets, such as our code, our sprites, our audio, etc.

:::tip
We recommend creating 4 folders for now, with the names:

- Backgrounds
- Scripts
- Sprites
- Prefabs
  :::

(Create a folder by Right Click > Create > Folder)

The importance of each folder will be explained in the future, but most of them are self-explanatory to what they will store
