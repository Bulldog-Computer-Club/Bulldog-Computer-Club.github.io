# Cooldog's Love Letter

Cooldog has written a love letter to his favorite dog in the entire world, Dankdog.
He wishes to ask her out for Valentine's Day.

However, Cooldog's friend Trolldog has committed a nefarious amount of tomfoolery and has inserted a number of seemingly random symbols into the love letter, much to Cooldog's dismay.

After examining the seemingly ruined letter, Cooldog observes to his delight that there is a pattern: Trolldog only ever inserts the characters `<`, `>`, and `@`. Thus, by removing all occurrences of these characters, he can obtain his original letter.

Because Cooldog is a busy student (and is behind on homework), he does not have the time to edit the letter himself. Help Cooldog out by outputting the original content of the letter.

## Input Specification

The input is one line containing the vandalized love letter, which consists of alphabetic characters in addition to `<`, `>`, and `@`.

## Output Specification

Output one line containing the original content of the letter after removing Trolldog's insertions.
