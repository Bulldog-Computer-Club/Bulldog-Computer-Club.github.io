Members of the Bulldog Computer Club have created some pretty impressive projects! In addition, we occasionally organize group projects we work on as a club. Here are some of those projects:

[`wave-generator`](https://github.com/AndreiSva/wave-generator)<br />
A cool terminal graphics demo program built in rust using crossterm.

[`rock-paper-scissors`](https://github.com/Bulldog-Computer-Club/rock-paper-scissors-practice)<br />
A collection of rock paper scissors implementations in various programming languages, worked on by the entire club.

[`oddify: Pokemon... but Oddish?`](https://github.com/liam-ilan/oddify)<br />
Oddish.

[`SWC-Bot`](https://github.com/Bulldog-Computer-Club/SWC-Bot)<br />
A discord bot for the the bulldog computer discord server (we don't use this anymore)
