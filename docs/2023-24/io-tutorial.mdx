In our first meeting, we introduced you to the format of the CCC — given a
problem, you are tasked with writing a program that solves it for some input. We
then looked at some past problems and worked through them by hand.

Now, let's see how to convert the process you used to solve a problem with pen
and paper into a program you can submit on the CCC.

## CCC Input/Output Format

One rather intriguing feature of the CCC is that **your solutions are autograded
in real time**. That is, you can submit a solution to the CCC grader and a
couple seconds later you can see the score it received (i.e., whether your
program worked.) Further, if your solution turns out to be incorrect, you can
edit it and submit again, to a maximum of fifty attempts.

To facilitate autograding, however, the CCC expects your program to accept input
and produce output in a specific way. In particular, your program should read
from standard input (stdin) and output to standard output (stdout.)
Colloquially, **your program needs to take input from the console and print
output to the console as well.**

The way to do this will differ depending on the language you are using and what
form the input takes (is it a number? a string? multiple numbers? etc.) Sample
code in Python, Java, and C++ follows.

## Introductory Example — CCC '20 J1

The most common kind of input in the CCC is numerical — you are given some
numbers as input and are to determine the corresponding output. For instance,
consider [CCC '20 J1 — Dog Treats](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc20j1). The premise
of this problem is that you have a dog whose happiness depends on the number of
small, medium, and large treats he receives in a day; you are tasked with
determining whether the dog is happy or sad.

Your program should, therefore, read three numbers from the console,
representing the amount of treats of each type. More precisely, the input
specification reads:

> There are three lines of input. Each line contains a non-negative integer less
> than $10$. The first line contains the number of small treats, $S$, the second
> line contains the number of medium treats, $M$, and the third line contains
> the number of large treats, $L$, that Barley receives in a day.

Worked solutions in Python, Java, and C++ are provided below.

**In Python, use the `input` function to get one line of input from the console;
use `print` for output.** Note, however, that since `input` returns a string, we will
need to convert it to an integer ourselves using the `int` constructor like such:

```py
small_treats = int(input())
medium_treats = int(input())
large_treats = int(input())
```

From there, we can finish solving the problem using the formula given and a
conditional (`if`) construct.

```py {5-9}
small_treats = int(input())
medium_treats = int(input())
large_treats = int(input())

happiness_score = 1 * small_treats + 2 * medium_treats + 3 * large_treats
if happiness_score >= 10:
    print("happy")
else:
    print("sad")
```

**In Java, use `java.util.Scanner` to read input from the console; use
`System.out.println` for output.** In this case, your input-reading logic might
look like:

```java
// Assuming java.util.Scanner is imported...
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int smallTreats = scanner.nextInt();
int mediumTreats = scanner.nextInt();
int largeTreats = scanner.nextInt();
```

From there, we can finish solving the problem using the formula given and a
conditional construct.

```java {6-8}
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int smallTreats = scanner.nextInt();
int mediumTreats = scanner.nextInt();
int largeTreats = scanner.nextInt();

int happinessScore = 1 * smallTreats + 2 * mediumTreats + 3 * largeTreats;
System.out.println(happinessScore >= 10 ? "happy" : "sad");
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

**In C++, use `std::cin` to read input from the console; use `std::cout` for output.**
In this case, your input-reading logic might look like:

```cpp
// Assuming std::cin and std::cout are in scope...
int small_treats{}, medium_treats{}, large_treats{};
std::cin >> small_treats >> medium_treats >> large_treats;
```

From there, we can finish solving the problem using the formula given and a
conditional construct.

```cpp {4-5}
int small_treats{}, medium_treats{}, large_treats{};
std::cin >> small_treats >> medium_treats >> large_treats;

int happiness_score = 1 * small_treats + 2 * medium_treats + 3 * large_treats;
std::cout << (happiness_score >= 10 ? "happy" : "sad") << '\n';
```

## Reading a Variable Number of Inputs — CCC '22 J2

Sometimes the amount of input for a problem will not be fixed. To understand
what is meant by this, consider [CCC '22 J2 — Fergusonball
Ratings](https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc22j2). The premise of this problem is that
you have some information about all the players in a sports team; you are tasked
with finding the star players. However, the number of players may vary from case
to case; the input specification reads:

> The first line of input consists of a positive integer $N$ representing the
> total number of players on the team. This is followed by a pair of consecutive
> lines for each player. The first line in a pair is the number of points that
> the player scored. The second line in a pair is the number of fouls that the
> player committed. Both the number of points and the number of fouls, are
> non-negative integers.

To account for this, your program should therefore read input in a loop,
stopping only after you have gathered information about all players on the team.
Sample code in Python, Java, and C++ is provided below.

<Tabs groupId="prog-langs">

<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

First, read the number of players on the team $N$; this will determine how many
times we need to loop.

```py
num_players = int(input())
```

Now, for each player, read the number of points they scored and the number of fouls committed
using a loop:

```py {3-5}
num_players = int(input())

for _ in range(num_players):
    points_scored = int(input())
    foul_count = int(input())
```
