Some CCC problems have large amounts of input (tens of thousands of lines),
which can cause an otherwise correct and efficient solution to time out while
reading the input.

To mitigate this issue, fast I/O methods can be used.

Instead of using `input()`, read directly from `sys.stdin`. A hacky way to do
this is to simply redefine `input` as `sys.stdin.readline` at the beginning of
your program:

```py
input = sys.stdin.readline
# Use input() as normal
```

Note, however, that the result of `sys.stdin.readline` will contain trailing
newlines, which may need to be stripped out manually.

`java.util.Scanner` has a number of useful features such as splitting using
regular expressions instead of whitespace and proper handling of non-ASCII
digits; however, these incur unnecessary overhead in most competitive
programming scenarios. For higher performance, a `java.io.BufferedReader` can be
used in combination with a `java.util.StringTokenizer`.

```java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

// Read an integer on one line
int i = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

// Read several integers on the same line
StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
while (st.hasMoreTokens()) {
	int i = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
}
```

One option is to use the C standard library functions `scanf` and `printf` instead
of the standard `std::cin` and `std::cout` streams; however, `scanf` and `printf`
can be somewhat unwieldy and error-prone.

On the other hand, if you want to keep using `std::cin` and `std::cout`, there are
two things you can do to improve their performance:

1.  _Unsync the C and C++ standard streams._ By default, the C and C++ standard
    streams are synced; this allows both to be used in the same program predictably.
    You can disable syncing by calling `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`. After
    doing this, you should refrain from using `scanf`/`printf` — instead, stick to
    `std::cin` and `std::cout`.

2.  _Untie `std::cin`._ By default, the standard input and output streams are tied,
    meaning any operations on one will automatically flush the other. This ensures
    sequences of operations like

    ```cpp
    int n{};
    std::cout << "What's your favorite number? ";
    std::cin >> n;
    ```

    behave as expected. If `std::cin` and `std::cout` are not tied, executing the above
    program may result in the prompt `What's your favorite number?` being output only _after_
    the user enters a number, as the output is buffered. If this is not an issue — as is the
    case in most CCC problems — `std::cin` may be untied via `std::cin.tie(nullptr)`.

In brief, to speed up `std::cin` and `std::cout`, add the following lines at the
beginning of your code:

```cpp
std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
std::cin.tie(nullptr);
```

Then, use `std::cin` and `std::cout` as usual.
