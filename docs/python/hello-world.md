# Introduction

Welcome to the Bulldog Computer Club. This will be a guide to get you on your feet with programming.

:::info
Programming is not an easy skill to learn. If you want to be successful, **please read this guide carefully**, and review/practice often!

Here is a table of contents covering all of our units.<br />
A new unit of this guide will be released each week.

## Unit 1

To get started, please open [futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io/course/#IntroducingTheShell) in a new tab

:::warning
You will be going back and forth between this tab, and the new tab, **so you might want to split-screen**.
:::

The tab you just opened is an interative python course, which will be a companion for this guide. That course will help you get started with learning how to write code, and in this guide, we will provide helpful tips, as well as **important practice questions**.

:::info
**Goals for this unit**

1. To learn how to use this guide and futurecoder
2. To complete up to `Using Variables and print()` in futurecoder
3. To learn how to use `'strings'` and add them
4. To learn how to use `print('word')` to display a word

:::
<br/><br/>

**So what do I do now?**
Now that you have the other tab open, we would like you to read the instructions on that page carefully. Follow them, and complete the problems that are presented to you. You can return to this page when you finish the question involving printing `'hello world'`.

<br/><br/>

Once you have fully understood that guide, try some of these questions.

1. What is the result of `'he' + 'llo' + 'world'`?
2. Fill in the blank: `'hello' + ' ' + 'wor' + ______` produces `hello worlds`.
3. What is the result of `'Hello ' + 'world ' + 'from ' + 't' + 'h' + 'e' + ' ' + 'Churchill Community'`?

<p>
1. <code>helloworld</code> - Each of the strings <code>(he, llo, world)</code> are added toghther, forming <code>helloworld</code>.<br/><br/>
2. <code>lds</code> - Notice how if you add all of the strings and ignore the blank, you get <code>hello wor</code>. Now to get <code>hello worlds</code>, you need to add the missing <code>lds</code>.<br/><br/>
3. <code>Hello World from the Churchill Community</code><br/>
</p></details>

<br/><br/>

Now we will continue on with the unit. Once again, you will need to follow futurecoder up to the part where you learn about `print(word + ' ' + your_name)`. Return here once you have fully understood up to that section.

<br/><br/>

Once you have fully understood that guide, try some of these questions.

1. What is the result of

```
word = 'orl'
print('w' + ' ' + word + 'd')
```

2. What is the result of

```
word = 'Hello'
print('word' + ' World')
```

3. Fill in the blanks:

_This should print out `Hello my World`_

```
word = 'Hel'
word2 = 'orld'
print(word + ______ + ______ + word2)
```

<details><summary>Click to reveal Solutions</summary>
<p>
1. <code>w orld</code> - <code>'orl'</code> is store inside the variable <code>word</code>, so all you need to do is add all of the strings <code>('w', ' ', 'orl', 'd')</code> toghther.<br/><br/>
2. <code>word World</code> - Notice that when we printed, we used the string <code>'word'</code> instead of the variable <code>word</code>.<br/><br/>
3. <code>'lo' and 'my W'</code><br/>
</p></details>

## Congrats! You have reached the end of this unit!

The next unit will be published next week. Stay tuned!
