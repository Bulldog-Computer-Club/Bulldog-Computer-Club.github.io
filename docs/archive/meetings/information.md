We meet every Monday during lunch in room 109 in Mrs. Braaten's room.

- Since we will meet in a computer lab, a personal computer / laptop is not required, but still recommended.
- If you got a personal computer, we can help you to set it up so that you can learn and code on it.

## Club Content

Our content this year is split into three topics, two of which are online only, meaning that an organizer will post content pertaining the topic regularly in the corresponding channel.
The other will be covered in our school meetings.

The list of topics is:

- Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) preparation / algorithms / data structures (organized by Joe)
- Game development (organized by Vincent)
- Linux usage (organized by Andrei)

:::info

Content for the online topics will be posted here on the website. Content related to the topic discussed in our school meetings will be part of our meeting transcripts.

**Game development** is the topic we will be covering at school meetings for the time being. A month or so before the CCC runs in February, we plan to temporarily switch to covering CCC during our meetings at school.

After that point, we may return to game development after the CCC is over, depending on the level of interest members show.

We also provide extra help on Teams and on our Discord community.
