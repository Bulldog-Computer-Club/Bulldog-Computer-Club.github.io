We meet every Monday during lunch in room 109 at Mrs. Braaten's room.

* Since we will meet in a computer lab, a personal computer (laptop) is not required, but still recommended!
* If you got a personal computer, we can help you to set it up so that you can learn and code on it!

Online meetings are also being considered.

We also provide extra help on Teams and on our Discord community
* [Join our Discord community here! Real name, grade and student number is required for verification!](https://discord.gg/U5q9WZauvB)
