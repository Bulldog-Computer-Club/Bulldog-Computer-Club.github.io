## Question of the Week (For Advanced)

Today's Question can be found [here](https://bulldog-computer-club.github.io/docs/ccc/nov-1)

## Learn Python (For Beginners)

[Futurecoder](https://futurecoder.io/) is the place that we will be learning Python on. We recommend you to practice at home, as the only way to get good is to keep on practicing.

## Future Competitions

After all the new beginners have learned the basic of python, we will begin our competitions.

First, we will split you into two groups, Beginner and Advanced. Beginners will mostly contain people who are still in the process of learning to code. The Advanced group will contain people who are moderately skilled in programming, or are up for a challenge. Each week, we will give out a question (similar to Today's Question of the day), and the first few people will gain points. Sometime at the end of this year / start of next year, prizes will be given out to the top scoreres in the beginner and advaned pools.
