The **CCC** topic is currently being organized by Joe and is purely online at the moment.
Related content will be posted here, on the website.

## Planned Content

:::note

The topics below have no specific time associated with them, but generally it can be expected that at least one topic will be covered per week.

:::

:::warning

A basic understanding of programming is expected for readers (i.e. you should know what if statements are, how to use functions, how to write loops, ...)

:::

- What is the CCC, and why should you be interested?
  - What language are supported, and which one should you use?
- Simple implementation questions: reading input and making decisions
  - Fast I/O methods
- Algorithmic analysis: Big-O notation
  - Why is it useful?
- Arrays/dynamic arrays
  - Sorting and searching
  - Binary search and variants
  - Two pointers
  - Prefix sums
- Stacks, queues, and deques
  - When are they useful?
  - Monotonic queue (maybe)
  - Minimum stack (maybe)
- Recursion
- Graphs
  - Representations
  - When to use breadth-first search over depth-first-search and vice versa?
  - Breadth-first search
    - Keeping track of depth
    - Dijkstra's (maybe)
  - Depth-first search
  - Meet-in-the-middle (maybe)
  - Modelling problems using graphs
- Dynamic programming (maybe)
  - Top-down and bottom-up
  - Classic problems
- CCC-specific topics
  - Getting partial points on problems
  - Brute forcing problems
