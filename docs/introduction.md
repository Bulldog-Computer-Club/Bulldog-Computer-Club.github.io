# Here is a _little_ bit of **code** that eat dogs:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// Here's a random comment.
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int sum = 0, k = 0;
	while (cin >> k) sum += k;
	cout << sum << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

And some `LaTeX`:

$$
A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \lor x \in B \}
