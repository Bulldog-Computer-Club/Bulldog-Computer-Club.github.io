## Topic Outline

Hi! I'm Andrei. I've been using Linux and similar operating systems for the past two years, so in this topic I want to casually explain and present different aspects of Linux and Unix-like operating systems. This topic is very different from the others, mostly focusing on computer history and general computer usage, although I will be organizing a significant "unit" that will contain very interesting programming concepts. This tutorial series is meant to guide completely inexperienced people from the basics of the command line to the usage of power user operating systems such as Arch Linux. I will try to post a tutorial discussing different aspects of Unix operating systems at least every two weeks.
